## General Code Review Guidelines

- Ensure the logic is correct, handles edge cases, and avoids regressions.
- Code should be easy to read and follow â€” clear naming, small functions, minimal nesting.
- Look for duplication and opportunities for refactoring (only highlight if something is notably problematic).
- Check for performance issues (e.g., unnecessary computations, redundant calls).
- Watch for security risks such as logging sensitive data or unsafe API calls.
