SDE 2 Flutter Developer Assignment
Offline‑First Pharmacy / E‑commerce App
Time Expectation: 4-6 hours 
Focus Areas: Architecture, state management, offline reliability, performance, and UX quality
1. Problem Statement
Build a production‑grade, offline‑first mobile application that allows users to browse products, view details, and manage a shopping cart. The goal is to evaluate engineering judgment, app architecture, and reliability under real‑world network conditions.
2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Product Listing Screen
Fetch products from an API and cache locally
App must work offline after the first successful sync
Search or filter by product name
Add to cart and update quantity directly from list
Show loading, empty, error, and offline states clearly
2.3 Cart Screen
List cart items
Update quantity or remove items
Display order total
Cart persists across app restarts
2.4 Offline & Sync Behavior (Important)
Local caching using database or storage of your choice (Hive/SQLite/Isar/etc.)
The app should remain usable with no internet
Show last updated or offline indicator
3. Technical Expectations
Clean, layered architecture (presentation, domain, data)
State management of your choice (Provider, Riverpod, Bloc, etc.) with short justification
Repository pattern or equivalent abstraction
Separation of concerns and testability
Proper error handling and edge cases
4. Performance & UX
Smooth scrolling lists
Efficient image loading and caching
Minimal unnecessary rebuilds
Responsive layouts for different screen sizes
5. Optional
Unit tests for at least 1–2 flows
6. API
You may use a mock backend or the Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/products). Static JSON is also acceptable.
7. Submission Guidelines
GitHub repository
Clear README with setup instructions
Architecture explanation and trade‑offs
Screenshots or short demo video (optional but appreciated)
