# Git & Version Control Rules

- Always raise PRs to the `develop` branch, not `main`/`master`
- Follow the GitHub PR template if it exists at `.github/pull_request_template.md`
- Never mention that code was written or generated by Claude Code in commits, PRs, or code comments
- Do not add `Co-Authored-By` trailer in commit messages
